"{\"value\":{\"mdx\":\"# Key Concepts\\n\\nUnderstanding these core concepts will help you grasp how FEY Protocol creates a self-sustaining, user-owned launchpad network.\\n\\n## Permissionless Ownership\\n\\nTraditional launchpads are **permissioned** - the company controls fee distribution, can change revenue sharing, and owns all decision-making power. FEY is **permissionless** - all core operations happen automatically through smart contracts without any central control.\\n\\n:::info[True Ownership]\\nWhen you hold $FEY, you own part of the protocol infrastructure itself. This is similar to holding BTC (ownership in Bitcoin network) or ETH (ownership in Ethereum network), not just utility tokens.\\n:::\\n\\n## Fee Distribution Model\\n\\n### How Fees Flow\\n\\n```mermaid\\ngraph TD\\n    A[User Trades] --> B[LP Fees Generated]\\n    B --> C[80% to Liquidity Providers]\\n    B --> D[20% to Protocol]\\n    D --> E[Collected in Paired Token]\\n    E --> F{Token Type}\\n    F -->|WETH| G[Factory → teamFeeRecipient]\\n    F -->|FEY| H[Factory → Fee Locker]\\n    H --> I[Stakers Claim Individually]\\n    G --> J[Manual Buyback → Staking Contract]\\n```\\n\\n### Automatic Distribution\\n\\n- **LP Fees**: Standard Uniswap V4 fees go to liquidity providers (80%)\\n- **Protocol Fees**: 20% of LP fees automatically route to the protocol\\n- **Collection**: Fees collected in the paired token (FEY or WETH)\\n- **Distribution**: 100% flows back to stakers through permissionless contracts\\n\\n## TOKEN/FEY Pairing Model\\n\\n### Why FEY Pairs?\\n\\nAll tokens deployed on FEY pair with $FEY rather than ETH or stablecoins. This creates:\\n\\n- **Buy Pressure**: Every trade creates demand for $FEY\\n- **Network Effects**: As more tokens launch, $FEY becomes more valuable\\n- **Creator Alignment**: Token creators earn rewards in $FEY, aligning them with protocol success\\n\\n### Bootstrap Exception\\n\\nThe $FEY token itself pairs with WETH to provide the base liquidity for the entire system. This WETH/FEY pool is the only exception to the FEY-pairing rule.\\n\\n## Staking & Reward Mechanics\\n\\n### Staking Benefits\\n\\nWhen you stake $FEY, you receive:\\n- **Protocol Fees**: From all trading activity across the network\\n- **LP Rewards**: From liquidity positions managed by the protocol\\n- **Buyback Distribution**: From automatic WETH→FEY conversions\\n\\n### Early Participant Advantage\\n\\nSince staking rewards are distributed proportionally, early stakers receive higher relative rewards because:\\n- Fewer total stakers = larger share of fees\\n- Growing network activity = increasing absolute rewards\\n- Fixed token supply = no dilution from new issuance\\n\\n## Creator Rewards System\\n\\n### How Creators Earn\\n\\nToken creators receive rewards through multiple mechanisms:\\n\\n1. **Direct Creator Fees**: 1% of trading volume in their token\\n2. **LP Position Rewards**: Fees from protocol-managed liquidity positions\\n3. **Network Participation**: All rewards paid in $FEY, giving creators exposure to network growth\\n\\n### Success Alignment\\n\\nThis model aligns creator success with network success:\\n- Successful tokens generate more trading volume\\n- More volume = more $FEY rewards for creators\\n- Creators become $FEY stakeholders, incentivized to promote the network\\n\\n## Automatic Buyback Mechanism\\n\\n### WETH → FEY Conversion\\n\\nThe protocol implements automatic buybacks:\\n\\n1. **WETH Accumulation**: Factory receives WETH fees from FEY/WETH pool\\n2. **Public Triggers**: Anyone can call `claimWethFees()` to release accumulated WETH\\n3. **Manual Buyback**: WETH goes to `teamFeeRecipient` who performs market buyback\\n4. **Distribution**: Purchased $FEY flows to staking contract for distribution\\n\\n:::warning[Manual Step]\\nThe buyback mechanism currently includes one manual step where `teamFeeRecipient` performs the actual WETH→FEY swap. This will be automated in future protocol upgrades.\\n:::\\n\\n## MEV Protection\\n\\n### Fair Launch Protection\\n\\nNew token pools receive MEV protection during launch:\\n- **Time Window**: 2-minute maximum protection period\\n- **Fee Adjustment**: MEV module can increase fees up to 80% to deter MEV\\n- **Auto-Disable**: Protection automatically expires or can be disabled by the module\\n- **Liquidity Block**: No liquidity changes allowed during protection window\\n\\n### No-Op Default\\n\\nThe current MEV module is a \\\"no-op\\\" that immediately disables itself, serving as a template for future MEV protection implementations.\\n\\n## Extension System\\n\\n### Modular Functionality\\n\\nFEY uses an extension system to add functionality:\\n- **Dev Buy Extensions**: Allow ETH purchases during token deployment\\n- **Future Extensions**: Airdrops, vesting, presales, etc.\\n- **Permissioned Extensions**: Must be approved through allowlist contract\\n- **Composable**: Multiple extensions can be used in single deployment\\n\\n### Current Extensions\\n\\n**FeyUniv4EthDevBuy** (`0x173077c319c38bb08D4C4968014357fd518446b4`)\\n- Enables ETH-based token purchases during deployment\\n- Automatically swaps ETH → WETH → FEY → new token\\n- Pure buy mechanism (no token allocation to extension)\\n\\n## Network Economics\\n\\n### Fixed Supply Model\\n\\n- **Total Supply**: 100,000,000,000 $FEY (100B tokens)\\n- **No Inflation**: Fixed supply, no new issuance\\n- **Deflationary Pressure**: Automatic buybacks reduce circulating supply\\n- **Value Accrual**: All network growth benefits existing holders\\n\\n### Self-Sustaining Loop\\n\\n1. More tokens deploy on FEY → More trading volume\\n2. More volume → More protocol fees → More rewards for stakers  \\n3. Higher staking rewards → More demand for $FEY\\n4. Higher $FEY price → Better creator rewards → Attracts more creators\\n5. Loop repeats, creating network effects\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Next Steps\\n\\nNow that you understand the key concepts:\\n\\n- **Start using FEY**: [Getting Started →](/getting-started)\\n- **Deep dive into architecture**: [Protocol Overview →](/architecture/overview)  \\n- **Learn about tokenomics**: [Token Mechanics →](/architecture/tokenomics)\\n- **Explore the contracts**: [Core Contracts →](/contracts/factory)\",\"document\":[]}}"
