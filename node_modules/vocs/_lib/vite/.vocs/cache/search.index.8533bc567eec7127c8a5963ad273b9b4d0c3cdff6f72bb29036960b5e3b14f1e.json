"{\"value\":{\"mdx\":\"# Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\nCommon questions about FEY Protocol, how it works, and how to participate.\\n\\n## General Questions\\n\\n### What is FEY Protocol?\\n\\nFEY Protocol is the first fully permissionless, user-owned launchpad built on Base. Unlike traditional launchpads owned by corporations, FEY operates as decentralized public infrastructure where users gain real ownership through staking $FEY tokens.\\n\\n**Key Differences:**\\n- 100% of protocol fees redistribute to token stakers\\n- No governance required for core operations\\n- Users own the infrastructure they use\\n- All operations are permissionless and automatic\\n\\n### How is FEY different from Pump.fun?\\n\\nWhile Pump.fun pioneered fair-launch mechanics, it remains a privately-owned corporation:\\n\\n| Feature | Pump.fun | FEY Protocol |\\n|---------|----------|-------------|\\n| **Ownership** | Corporate shareholders | Token stakers (users) |\\n| **Fee Distribution** | To company treasury | 100% to stakers |\\n| **Revenue Sharing** | At company discretion | Automatic & permanent |\\n| **Buybacks** | Optional company decision | Automatic & public |\\n| **Control** | Centralized team | Permissionless contracts |\\n\\n### What does \\\"permissionless\\\" mean?\\n\\nPermissionless means that core protocol operations happen automatically through smart contracts without requiring approval from any central authority:\\n\\n- Fee distribution is automatic\\n- Buybacks are triggered by public functions\\n- No governance votes needed for basic operations\\n- Anyone can call maintenance functions\\n\\n## Token Economics\\n\\n### How does the $FEY token work?\\n\\n$FEY serves multiple roles in the ecosystem:\\n\\n**Base Pairing Token**: All deployed tokens pair with $FEY (not ETH)\\n**Staking Token**: Stake $FEY to earn protocol fees\\n**Reward Token**: Token creators earn fees in $FEY\\n**Governance Token**: Future DAO functionality (not yet active)\\n\\n**Key Properties:**\\n- Fixed supply: 100,000,000,000 $FEY (100B tokens)\\n- No inflation: No new tokens ever created\\n- Burnable: Tokens can be permanently removed\\n- Cross-chain: Compatible with Superchain bridges\\n\\n### How do staking rewards work?\\n\\nWhen you stake $FEY, you earn from multiple revenue streams:\\n\\n**Protocol Fees**: 20% of all LP fees from every pool\\n**LP Rewards**: Fees from protocol-managed liquidity positions  \\n**Buyback Distribution**: $FEY purchased from automatic WETH conversion\\n\\n**Distribution Mechanism:**\\n1. Fees accumulate in the Fee Locker contract\\n2. Stakers can claim their share anytime\\n3. Rewards are proportional to staked amount\\n4. Early stakers get higher relative rewards\\n\\n:::info[Staking is Live!]\\nStaking is now active! You can stake your $FEY tokens directly on [fey.money](https://fey.money), interact with the smart contract at `0x72f5565Ab147105614ca4Eb83ecF15f751Fd8C50` by calling the `deposit` function, or use the Farcaster miniapp by [@jpfraneto.eth](https://farcaster.xyz/jpfraneto.eth) at [this link](https://farcaster.xyz/jpfraneto.eth/0xcc27e5ac).\\n:::\\n\\n### What creates buy pressure for $FEY?\\n\\nSeveral mechanisms create consistent demand:\\n\\n**Trading Volume**: Every token pairs with $FEY, so all trades involve $FEY\\n**Creator Rewards**: Token creators earn fees in $FEY, becoming stakeholders\\n**Automatic Buybacks**: WETH fees are converted to $FEY and distributed\\n**Staking Demand**: Users need $FEY to earn protocol fees\\n\\n## Using the Protocol\\n\\n### How do I deploy a token on FEY?\\n\\nToken deployment involves several steps:\\n\\n1. **Prepare Configuration**: Token metadata, liquidity settings, reward splits\\n2. **Deploy via Factory**: Call `deployToken()` with your configuration\\n3. **Include Extensions**: Add ETH for dev buy or other extensions\\n4. **Automatic Setup**: Protocol handles pool creation, liquidity, and MEV protection\\n\\nSee our detailed [Token Deployment Guide →](/flows/deployment) for complete instructions.\\n\\n### What are extensions?\\n\\nExtensions add functionality to token deployments:\\n\\n**FeyUniv4EthDevBuy**: Purchase tokens with ETH during deployment\\n**Future Extensions**: Presales, airdrops, vesting, team allocations\\n\\nExtensions must be approved through the allowlist contract and can be combined in a single deployment.\\n\\n### How do creator rewards work?\\n\\nToken creators earn multiple types of rewards:\\n\\n**Creator Fees**: 1% of trading volume in their token\\n**LP Position Rewards**: Fees from protocol-managed liquidity\\n**Network Growth**: All rewards paid in $FEY, so creators benefit from network success\\n\\n**Reward Flow:**\\n1. Trading generates LP fees\\n2. Creator's share flows to LP Locker\\n3. LP Locker distributes to configured recipients\\n4. Recipients can claim from Fee Locker\\n\\n### Can I stake $FEY now?\\n\\nYes! Staking is now live and you have several options:\\n\\n**Web Interface**: Visit [fey.money](https://fey.money) for the easiest staking experience\\n\\n**Farcaster Miniapp**: Use the miniapp by [@jpfraneto.eth](https://farcaster.xyz/jpfraneto.eth) at [this link](https://farcaster.xyz/jpfraneto.eth/0xcc27e5ac)\\n\\n**Direct Contract Interaction**: Call the `deposit` function on the staking contract at `0x72f5565Ab147105614ca4Eb83ecF15f751Fd8C50`\\n\\n**Staking Benefits**:\\n- Earn fees from all protocol activity\\n- Proportional rewards based on your staked amount\\n- Claim rewards through the Fee Locker anytime\\n\\n## Technical Questions\\n\\n### What blockchain is FEY on?\\n\\nFEY Protocol is deployed on **Base Mainnet** (Chain ID: 8453).\\n\\n**Why Base?**\\n- Lower transaction costs than Ethereum\\n- Fast block times and finality\\n- Growing DeFi ecosystem\\n- Superchain compatibility for future expansion\\n\\n### What is Uniswap V4 and why does FEY use it?\\n\\nUniswap V4 is the latest version of the Uniswap protocol with advanced features:\\n\\n**Hooks System**: Custom logic for pools (FEY uses this for fee management)\\n**Dynamic Fees**: Fees can change based on market conditions\\n**Gas Efficiency**: Lower costs for swaps and liquidity operations\\n**Singleton Architecture**: All pools share one contract\\n\\nFEY's hook integrates deeply with V4 to provide:\\n- Automatic fee collection\\n- Dynamic fee adjustment\\n- MEV protection\\n- Extension system integration\\n\\n### How does MEV protection work?\\n\\nNew token pools receive MEV protection during their first 2 minutes:\\n\\n**Protection Features:**\\n- MEV module can increase fees up to 80% to deter MEV bots\\n- No liquidity changes allowed during protection window\\n- Automatically expires after 2 minutes\\n\\n**Current Implementation:**\\n- Uses a \\\"no-op\\\" module that immediately disables itself\\n- Serves as template for future MEV protection strategies\\n- Can be upgraded to more sophisticated protection\\n\\n### Are the contracts audited?\\n\\nContract audit status:\\n- **Smart Contract Review**: Internal security review completed\\n- **External Audit**: In progress with reputable auditing firm\\n- **Bug Bounty**: Community bug bounty program planned\\n\\n**Security Features:**\\n- Multiple access controls and permission systems\\n- Freeze mechanisms for critical parameters\\n- Capped fees and MEV protection limits\\n- Reentrancy protection on critical functions\\n\\n### How can I verify contract authenticity?\\n\\nAll contracts are verified on BaseScan:\\n\\n1. **Check Addresses**: Use our [official address list →](/reference/addresses)\\n2. **Verify Source Code**: All contracts have verified source on BaseScan\\n3. **Token Verification**: Official $FEY token has verification status\\n4. **Social Verification**: Follow [@feyprotocol](https://twitter.com/feyprotocol) for official announcements\\n\\n## Troubleshooting\\n\\n### Why can't I deploy a token?\\n\\nCommon issues and solutions:\\n\\n**Factory Deprecated**: Factory may be temporarily disabled\\n- *Solution*: Wait for reactivation or check if you need bootstrap access\\n\\n**Base Token Not Set**: Protocol not fully initialized  \\n- *Solution*: Wait for protocol bootstrap completion\\n\\n**Extension Not Enabled**: Extension not approved in allowlist\\n- *Solution*: Contact team to add extension to allowlist\\n\\n**Configuration Errors**: Invalid deployment configuration\\n- *Solution*: Check that all arrays have matching lengths and reward BPS sum to 10,000\\n\\n### Where are my creator rewards?\\n\\nRewards flow through several contracts:\\n\\n1. **Check LP Locker**: Ensure `collectRewards()` is being called for your token\\n2. **Check Fee Locker**: Query `availableFees()` for your address\\n3. **Claim Rewards**: Call `claim()` function to withdraw available fees\\n\\nUse our [Cast commands →](/guides/cast-commands) to check reward status.\\n\\n### Why isn't my extension working?\\n\\nExtension troubleshooting:\\n\\n1. **Check Allowlist**: Verify extension is enabled in allowlist contract\\n2. **Check Pool Configuration**: Ensure extension is properly registered\\n3. **Check Extension Data**: Verify extension data is correctly encoded\\n4. **Check ETH Amount**: Ensure sufficient ETH sent for extension\\n\\n### How do I get support?\\n\\n**Community Support:**\\n- Discord: [Join our community](https://discord.gg/feyprotocol)\\n- Twitter: [@feyprotocol](https://twitter.com/feyprotocol)\\n-
