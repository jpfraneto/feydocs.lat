# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about FEY Protocol, how it works, and how to participate.

## General Questions

### What is FEY Protocol?

FEY Protocol is the first fully permissionless, user-owned launchpad built on Base. Unlike traditional launchpads owned by corporations, FEY operates as decentralized public infrastructure where users gain real ownership through staking $FEY tokens.

**Key Differences:**
- 100% of protocol fees redistribute to token stakers
- No governance required for core operations
- Users own the infrastructure they use
- All operations are permissionless and automatic

### How is FEY different from Pump.fun?

While Pump.fun pioneered fair-launch mechanics, it remains a privately-owned corporation:

| Feature | Pump.fun | FEY Protocol |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Corporate shareholders | Token stakers (users) |
| **Fee Distribution** | To company treasury | 100% to stakers |
| **Revenue Sharing** | At company discretion | Automatic & permanent |
| **Buybacks** | Optional company decision | Automatic & public |
| **Control** | Centralized team | Permissionless contracts |

### What does "permissionless" mean?

Permissionless means that core protocol operations happen automatically through smart contracts without requiring approval from any central authority:

- Fee distribution is automatic
- Buybacks are triggered by public functions
- No governance votes needed for basic operations
- Anyone can call maintenance functions

## Token Economics

### How does the $FEY token work?

$FEY serves multiple roles in the ecosystem:

**Base Pairing Token**: All deployed tokens pair with $FEY (not ETH)
**Staking Token**: Stake $FEY to earn protocol fees
**Reward Token**: Token creators earn fees in $FEY
**Governance Token**: Future DAO functionality (not yet active)

**Key Properties:**
- Fixed supply: 100,000,000,000 $FEY (100B tokens)
- No inflation: No new tokens ever created
- Burnable: Tokens can be permanently removed
- Cross-chain: Compatible with Superchain bridges

### How do staking rewards work?

When you stake $FEY, you earn from multiple revenue streams:

**Protocol Fees**: 20% of all LP fees from every pool
**LP Rewards**: Fees from protocol-managed liquidity positions  
**Buyback Distribution**: $FEY purchased from automatic WETH conversion

**Distribution Mechanism:**
1. Fees accumulate in the Fee Locker contract
2. Stakers can claim their share anytime
3. Rewards are proportional to staked amount
4. Early stakers get higher relative rewards

### What creates buy pressure for $FEY?

Several mechanisms create consistent demand:

**Trading Volume**: Every token pairs with $FEY, so all trades involve $FEY
**Creator Rewards**: Token creators earn fees in $FEY, becoming stakeholders
**Automatic Buybacks**: WETH fees are converted to $FEY and distributed
**Staking Demand**: Users need $FEY to earn protocol fees

## Using the Protocol

### How do I deploy a token on FEY?

Token deployment involves several steps:

1. **Prepare Configuration**: Token metadata, liquidity settings, reward splits
2. **Deploy via Factory**: Call `deployToken()` with your configuration
3. **Include Extensions**: Add ETH for dev buy or other extensions
4. **Automatic Setup**: Protocol handles pool creation, liquidity, and MEV protection

See our detailed [Token Deployment Guide →](/flows/deployment) for complete instructions.

### What are extensions?

Extensions add functionality to token deployments:

**FeyUniv4EthDevBuy**: Purchase tokens with ETH during deployment
**Future Extensions**: Presales, airdrops, vesting, team allocations

Extensions must be approved through the allowlist contract and can be combined in a single deployment.

### How do creator rewards work?

Token creators earn multiple types of rewards:

**Creator Fees**: 1% of trading volume in their token
**LP Position Rewards**: Fees from protocol-managed liquidity
**Network Growth**: All rewards paid in $FEY, so creators benefit from network success

**Reward Flow:**
1. Trading generates LP fees
2. Creator's share flows to LP Locker
3. LP Locker distributes to configured recipients
4. Recipients can claim from Fee Locker

### Can I stake $FEY now?

Yes! Staking is now live and you have several options:

**Web Interface**: Visit [fey.money](https://fey.money) for the easiest staking experience

**Farcaster Miniapp**: Use the miniapp by [@jpfraneto.eth](https://farcaster.xyz/jpfraneto.eth) at [this link](https://farcaster.xyz/jpfraneto.eth/0xcc27e5ac)

**Direct Contract Interaction**: Call the `deposit` function on the staking contract at `0x72f5565Ab147105614ca4Eb83ecF15f751Fd8C50`

**Staking Benefits**:
- Earn fees from all protocol activity
- Proportional rewards based on your staked amount
- Claim rewards through the Fee Locker anytime

## Technical Questions

### What blockchain is FEY on?

FEY Protocol is deployed on **Base Mainnet** (Chain ID: 8453).

**Why Base?**
- Lower transaction costs than Ethereum
- Fast block times and finality
- Growing DeFi ecosystem
- Superchain compatibility for future expansion

### What is Uniswap V4 and why does FEY use it?

Uniswap V4 is the latest version of the Uniswap protocol with advanced features:

**Hooks System**: Custom logic for pools (FEY uses this for fee management)
**Dynamic Fees**: Fees can change based on market conditions
**Gas Efficiency**: Lower costs for swaps and liquidity operations
**Singleton Architecture**: All pools share one contract

FEY's hook integrates deeply with V4 to provide:
- Automatic fee collection
- Dynamic fee adjustment
- MEV protection
- Extension system integration

### How does MEV protection work?

New token pools receive MEV protection during their first 2 minutes:

**Protection Features:**
- MEV module can increase fees up to 80% to deter MEV bots
- No liquidity changes allowed during protection window
- Automatically expires after 2 minutes

**Current Implementation:**
- Uses a "no-op" module that immediately disables itself
- Serves as template for future MEV protection strategies
- Can be upgraded to more sophisticated protection

### Are the contracts audited?

Contract audit status:
- **Smart Contract Review**: Internal security review completed
- **External Audit**: In progress with reputable auditing firm
- **Bug Bounty**: Community bug bounty program planned

**Security Features:**
- Multiple access controls and permission systems
- Freeze mechanisms for critical parameters
- Capped fees and MEV protection limits
- Reentrancy protection on critical functions

### How can I verify contract authenticity?

All contracts are verified on BaseScan:

1. **Check Addresses**: Use our [official address list →](/reference/addresses)
2. **Verify Source Code**: All contracts have verified source on BaseScan
3. **Token Verification**: Official $FEY token has verification status
4. **Social Verification**: Follow [@feyprotocol](https://twitter.com/feyprotocol) for official announcements

## Troubleshooting

### Why can't I deploy a token?

Common issues and solutions:

**Factory Deprecated**: Factory may be temporarily disabled
- *Solution*: Wait for reactivation or check if you need bootstrap access

**Base Token Not Set**: Protocol not fully initialized  
- *Solution*: Wait for protocol bootstrap completion

**Extension Not Enabled**: Extension not approved in allowlist
- *Solution*: Contact team to add extension to allowlist

**Configuration Errors**: Invalid deployment configuration
- *Solution*: Check that all arrays have matching lengths and reward BPS sum to 10,000

### Where are my creator rewards?

Rewards flow through several contracts:

1. **Check LP Locker**: Ensure `collectRewards()` is being called for your token
2. **Check Fee Locker**: Query `availableFees()` for your address
3. **Claim Rewards**: Call `claim()` function to withdraw available fees

Use our [Cast commands →](/guides/cast-commands) to check reward status.

### Why isn't my extension working?

Extension troubleshooting:

1. **Check Allowlist**: Verify extension is enabled in allowlist contract
2. **Check Pool Configuration**: Ensure extension is properly registered
3. **Check Extension Data**: Verify extension data is correctly encoded
4. **Check ETH Amount**: Ensure sufficient ETH sent for extension
