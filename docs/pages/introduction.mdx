# What is FEY Protocol?

FEY Protocol is the first fully permissionless, user-owned launchpad built on Base. Unlike traditional launchpads owned by corporations, FEY operates as decentralized public infrastructure where users gain real ownership through staking.

## The Vision

*"Everything will be tokenized"* - this has been a thesis in crypto for years. Pumpfun proved this out as the first successful fair-launch platform, becoming one of the most profitable onchain experiments ever, reaching $750M revenue faster than any other protocol.

However, all existing launchpads share a fundamental problem: **they are privately-owned corporations**. While built on crypto rails for crypto participants, their structure and ownership remain from the old world.

FEY changes this by creating the first **user-owned launchpad network** where:
- 100% of protocol fees redistribute to token holders
- Operations are completely permissionless 
- Users get real ownership, not just utility tokens
- The network is self-sustaining without external capital

## How FEY Works

### Core Mechanics

**🔄 Automatic Fee Distribution**
- 20% of all LP fees flow to the protocol
- Fees are collected in the paired token (FEY for most pools, WETH for the base pool)
- 100% redistribution to stakers through permissionless contracts

**💎 TOKEN/FEY Pairing**
- All deployed tokens pair with $FEY (similar to Zora's model)
- Creates constant buy pressure on $FEY from every trade
- Token creators earn rewards in $FEY, aligning them with network growth

**⚡ Permissionless Buybacks**
- WETH fees trigger automatic $FEY buybacks
- Anyone can call the buyback function (typically every 60 seconds)
- Purchased $FEY is distributed to active stakers

**🛡️ MEV Protection**
- New pools get 2-minute MEV protection window
- Prevents sniping during fair launches
- Automatically disables to allow normal trading

### Network Participants

**Token Creators**
- Deploy tokens on FEY and earn creator rewards
- Receive 1% of trading fees in $FEY
- Gain exposure to network growth through $FEY holdings

**Stakers**
- Stake $FEY to receive protocol fee distributions
- Earn from all trading activity across the network
- True ownership stake in launchpad infrastructure

**Traders**
- Access to fair-launch tokens with MEV protection
- Trade on Uniswap V4 with dynamic fee optimization
- Benefit from deep liquidity provided by the protocol

## Key Differences from Other Launchpads

| Feature | Traditional Launchpads | FEY Protocol |
|---------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Ownership** | Corporate shareholders | Token stakers (users) |
| **Fee Distribution** | To company treasury | 100% to stakers |
| **Revenue Sharing** | At company discretion | Automatic & permanent |
| **Governance** | Centralized decisions | Permissionless operations |
| **Creator Rewards** | Fiat or company tokens | Network token ($FEY) |
| **Buybacks** | Optional company decision | Automatic & public |

## Why This Matters

FEY represents a return to crypto's founding principles:
- **Self-sovereignty**: Users own the infrastructure they use
- **Permissionless**: No central authority controls operations  
- **Aligned incentives**: All participants benefit from network growth
- **Public goods**: Infrastructure owned by its users, not corporations

When you participate in FEY, you're not just using a launchpad - you're becoming a co-owner of the network itself.
